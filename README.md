Fork of a fork of the code examples from the book "Computational Semantics with Functional Programming" (Jan van Eijck, Christina Unger, N.Y.: Cambridge University Press, 2010) http://www.computational-semantics.eu/

The book is about applications of logic in the semantic analysis of language. The method used throughout in the book is the pursuit of logical questions and implementation issues occasioned by concrete examples of formally defined language fragments. Throughout the text, abstract concepts are linked to concrete representations in the functional programming language Haskell. This language is introduced through its core language: the simple and, then, the typed lambda calculus. The source code in this repository is aimed to run in the old Hugs or the current GHC Haskell interpreter.
